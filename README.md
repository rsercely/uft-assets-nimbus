# Script-Directory
This is planned to be a landing page to help expose several demo assets that the field has found useful as part of a core demo or taylored demo.

**Most** of these scripts are not considered as part of the "core" demo assets which means you will **not** find them delivered as part of the [devops.dockerapp](https://hub.docker.com/r/admpresales/devops.dockerapp/) or the [devops](https://hub.docker.com/r/admpresales/devops/) images.  Scripts that are shown on this page that are part of the core scripts delivered in the Devops image are noted with '(c)'.  For example:
```
leanft-gherkin (c)
```

Instructions on [How to add test to devops container](#how-to-add-test-to-devops-container) can be found below.  Please make sure all projects have a useful README.md on how one should use the script.  Help on how to create the README.md using the github markdown language can be found:

## How to add test to devops container
&#x1F340; `If you can connect to www.github.com from your devops container, then from a terminal window on NimbusServer with the devops container up, run the following command:`

```
docker exec devops bash -c "su -s /bin/bash -c 'git clone --mirror https://github.com/admpresales/aos-web-lft4se.git /gitrepo/aos-web-lft4se' apache"
```

`If your container can not connect to the internet, then use these from your terminal window`
```
git clone --mirror https://github.com/admpresales/aos-web-lft4se.git aos-web-lft4se
docker cp aos-web-lft4se devops:/gitrepo
docker exec devops bash -c 'chown -R apache:apache /gitrepo/aos-web-lft4se'
```
**You would of course replace the url and name to the git project you wish to use in the above steps**
